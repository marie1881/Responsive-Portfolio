      <p>Hi ! I'm here to tell you a little bit about myself. I turned 21 this month, a day before our first lesson at bootcamp. I recently bought a house and I'm looking to get a dog soon. My favourite TV series is, Avatar the Last Airbender, I love gaming and I just started streaming on Twitch. My favourite games are COD, Need for Speed, Apex Legends, Overwatch, God of War and Sims 4.</p>

      <p>I currently work as an admin for a packaging/printing company, i'm in charge of the accounts and distribution of goods. My background is half Thai and half Italian and I was born in Perth, WA. I really enjoy coding, although it is quite tricky and frustrating at times.</p>

      <p>Some good Netflix series are, Suits and David Attenborough (the deep sea episode to be exact).One of my favourite hobbies is painting or drawing. Since I recently bought a house, I really love gardening and I never thought I would, I feel old ...</p>
